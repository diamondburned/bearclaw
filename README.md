## what's a static site generator
a static site is a site with no fancy clicky things, signups, comments, just plain html. writing a raw html page for your blog makes it load very fast, but there's a lot of typing involved when designing it. markdown is a simpler and faster way to write pages, and bearclaw converts those markdown files to html for you, with your style template. 

no node-modules, no react, no fancy stuff or cool emojis. it just works.

## how do we use it?
bearclaw can be run on-demand, or it can rebuild automatically when it sees changes. there are 3 folders in the basic install: `markdown`, `output`, and `templates`. there is an optional 4th folder after v1.2.0 for `plugins`.

- **markdown** - all your new posts go here
- **output** - bearclaw puts your html and rss here
- **templates** - header.html and footer.html
- ***plugins*** *(optional)* - extra features for your page

that's it! point your webserver at `output` or handle it however is best for your case.

**tip:** you can run `bearclaw` and it will run once, or you can use `./bearclaw --watch` to watch the current folder for changes.

## plugins
bearclaw supports plugins. plugins can be installed in the plugins folder and called in your markdown or html pages using an html comment like this: `<!-- plugin "./plugins/myCoolPlugin/comments.html" -->`. bearclaw will swap the comment for the contents of the plugin file at the specified path.

## issues

if you run in to issues, there's a short bug report form you can fill out, or you can contribute with a pull-request.
